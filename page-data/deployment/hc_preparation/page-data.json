The config options from the\nbefore mentioned [Configuration Reference](/deployment/config-reference) topic should be used with these files.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n### Configuring IBM MQ\n\nIBM MQ is already configured to work out of the box with a secure connection with IBM WebSphere Liberty.\nThe commands that create all the objects that are needed on the queue manager are defined in a config map, in the `configmap-mqsc.yaml` file.\n\nThe password for the IBM MQ web console can be retrieved from the created Secret resource using the following command **after** it has been deployed:\n\n```shell\nkubectl get secret <releaseName>-mq-credentials -o go-template='{{.data.adminPasswordKey | base64decode}}{{\"\\n\"}}'\n```\n\n## Packaging the Helm charts\n\nTo use the Helm Charts to install SPM, package the charts and load them into a repository.
