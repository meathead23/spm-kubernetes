Otherwise, Tiller does not work properly.\n\n## Context Root Not Found error on the SPM home page, BIRT, or caseload summary pages\n\nThe `Context Root Not Found` error occurs because the deployment does not install the BIRT application.\n\n## The logs are filled by repetitions of the ICWWKS4001I message\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n[1/22/19 8:48:18:272 GMT] 000000ba com.ibm.ws.security.token.internal.TokenManagerImpl ICWWKS4001I: The security token cannot be validated. This can be for the following reasons:\n1. The security token was generated on another server using different keys.\n2. The token configuration or the security keys of the token service that created the token has been changed.\n3. The token service that created the token is no longer available.\n```\n\nThe root cause is users not clearing the browser cache after the application is redeployed. Users might have old, local cookie files.\n\nHowever, after a redeployment or an upgrade, the application does not recognize the cookies that are presented to it by the computer, which causes the error messages in the logs.\n\n## Limitations when using the Minikube none driver\n\nThere are a number of limitations associated with the Minikube none driver that are documented in [Minikube documentation](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/reference/drivers/none/).\nYou must evaluate the impacts of these limitations for your implementation.\n\nHowever, the unavailability of the `minikube ssh` command might make it difficult to analyze and resolve problems and issues. For example, switching to the kvm2 driver enables the use of `minikube ssh` and resolves issues with the Docker Registry.\n\n## Storage initialized using a runbook version older than 20.9.0\n\nIf storage has been initialized using a version of the runbook older than 20.9.0, you will need to update your\noverride values to include a supplementary group:\n\n```yaml\nglobal:\n  mq:\n    security:\n      context:\n        supplementalGroups: [888]\n```\n\nThis is due to a update in IBM MQ, the details of which can be found [here](https://github.com/IBM/charts/blob/master/stable/ibm-mqadvanced-server-dev/RELEASENOTES.md).\n\n## IBM MQ XAER_PROTO issue\n\nThe following issue has been observed in the JMS Consumer pods when JMS transactions is processed by a newly deployed pod, at the initial JMS transactions. The exception in thrown by the IBM MQ Resource Adapter.\n\n```log\n[INFO    ] FFDC1015I: An FFDC Incident has been created: \"javax.transaction.xa.XAException: The method 'xa_start' has failed with errorCode '-6'. com.ibm.tx.jta.impl.JTAXAResourceImpl.start 307\" at ...\n[INFO    ] FFDC1015I: An FFDC Incident has been created: \"javax.transaction.xa.XAException: The method 'xa_start' has failed with errorCode '-6'. com.ibm.tx.jta.impl.RegisteredResources.startRes 1053\" at ...\n[ERROR   ] WTRN0078E: An attempt by the transaction manager to call start on a transactional resource has resulted in an error.\nThe error code was XAER_PROTO.
